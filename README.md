## Architecture

![sibyl architecture](https://gdurl.com/JdaT)

#### Frontend

The client app uses a domain-driven structure, keeping related components as close as possible, and the heirarchy relatively flat. Shared components and util files live in separate directories.

#### Backend

The server uses the MVC pattern, and moves the logic for manipulating request and response data to a service layer between the controller and the model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To properly run the app in a local development environment, environment variables are required.

- The `client` app requires a Google Places API Key that can be obtained here. See the `.env.example` file included in `/client` for reference to the required environment variable name
- The `server` app requires an API Key from the Open Weather API. See the `.env.example` file included in `/server` for reference to the required environment variable name

In both the `/server` and `/client` directories:

1. Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename to `.env.development` or `.env` depending on your needs
2. Add your API Key for the respective service

### Installation

1. Install client packages
   - From the project root directory run `cd client && npm install`
2. Install server packages
   - From the project root directory run `cd server && npm install`

To start the client and server apps, navigate to the respective folders and run `npm start`
